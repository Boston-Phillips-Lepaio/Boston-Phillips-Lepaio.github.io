      <div class="page-one-about-me">
        <p> When it comes to identity, I'm proud of who I am.</p>
        <p> In a nutshell, the people in my life have crafted the person I am today. I keep a tight network of friends around myself, they've been with me through thick and thin, and the conversations and experiences we share often shape me as a person and how I look at life in a more positive light.</p>
        <p> Growing up, i've been through many challenges and triumps that have moulded me into the person I am today. I've worked in retail and customer service for 3 years which allowed me to pick up skills; dealing with all kinds of customers taught me how to communicate well (an area I sometimes struggled with) and handle different situations with patience. These strengths will help me in my learning journey</p>
        <p> Limitations I often encounter are time constraints and learning blocks. I enjoy attempting to make projects that are often outside of my current scope of ability and when I'm unable to bring my wireframes to fruition I get frustrated and spend more time than I should on the projects.</p>
        <p> Working with others, I've noticed I tend to be Mr. Compliance. I shy away from confrontation, resistance and tension, especially in new areas where I'm still finding my feet. I need to find that sweet spot between going along with things and speaking up for my ideas.</p>
        <p> I made an ethical decision at work when my manager was mistreating one of my co-workers by loudly berating him in an unprofessional manner. After being a witness to this event I consoled and told my co-worker how he should go about reporting this to the Union because no one should be treated that way.</p>
