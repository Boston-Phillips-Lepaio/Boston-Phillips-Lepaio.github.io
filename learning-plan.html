      <div class="page-one-about-me">
        <p> My original plan to find a job in software and work from home is still on, in fact I'm probably more motivated than ever. No destinatiosn in mind, I just want to get out there. </p>
        <p> For strengths and weaknesses I've toned down the need to be perfect and instead have come to the terms that I'm just a beginner, I can only get better from here. My new found strength is my infinitely growing brain. </p>
        <p> My biggest non-technical challenge would definitley being working in groups and anything group related. I hope I can overcome these challenges in bootcamp. </p>
        <p> The human skills I want to develop that I've already dipped in a little is neuroplasticity and how I can grow. As well as my communication and teamwork skills most importantly.</p>
        <p> My expectations from the bootcamp team is to be able to support me through the daunting task that is bootcamp. I don't expect to coast through easily and when I feel blocked I hope the team at bootcamp can have my back. </p>
        <p> What I expect from myself in bootcamp is to stick to the books, commit myself to the 60 hour weeks of work and study I have to put in from week 7 onward. Get adequate sleep and don't slack off even though I know I want to. I'll also come into the wellington campus when possible. </p>
