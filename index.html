        <p> Hola reader, my name is Boston, born in welly and raised in ptown. I heard about Dev Academy through word of mouth and I've been enjoying everything about the learning process so far. I came here because I was looking to escape the drooling boredom of my 9-5 rinse and repeat retail life. And what better way to do that than to finally pursue an interest I've always had in software development  üí™ üò§This is my first year taking coding and everything seems fresh, new and exciting. My values are hard work and perseverance and I'm eagerly looking forward to what the future has in store for me. Let's work together üëç</p>
