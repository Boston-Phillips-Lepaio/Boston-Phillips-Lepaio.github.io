      <p class="paragraph-font"> 
        I had a problem in the javascript kata on the Capitalize question. It was insanely tough and used a lot of built-in methods within 
        one function. To solve it I had to first understand my methods and what they did. I googled them to find out their proper use and 
        syntax. Throughout the process I felt like everything was slowly being put together like puzzle pieces, connecting one made 
        it easier to figure out the next course of action. I learned that MDN web docs is my favourite website to work on. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-font"> 
        I elegantly solved the concatMyArray problem in the javascript kata. After coming off of the capitalize question this one looked WAY 
        easier and I had already experimented with the required method: array.join() . This made solving the problem insanely easy, I was confused 
        on needing to have the words meshed together in a string withOUT spaces though. Being able to complete that question so easily made me feel very 
        confident. Here I learnt the more experience I get, the easier previous stuff should become.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-font"> 
        Pseudocode I still need to really write down, At this point I kinda just pseudocode in my head like "ok first I need to change this string into an array... how can I do that?" <br>
        I feel confident trying something just to see if it works, if it doesn't? ctrl + z. <br>
        I don't really use the rubber ducky method <br>
        Reading error messages are great because they tell me which line is messing up. <br>
        Console logging is amazing, if you want to know if this part of your code is working? Console log it. <br>
        Googling I use a lot, my penultimate straw when working on something is to use ChatGPT and break down how the code was used to solve it- Working backwards. <br>
        Asking peers/coaches for help is my final straw when working on something. It's something I know for a fact will lead me to the answer so I feel confident to ask about. <br>
        Reflecting is great I do it a lot, When I have working code I try to explain it to someone who doesn't know what it does, I feel like if I can explain it well then I have a good understanding of what I'm working with <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm often reluctant to ask for help because as stated above it's my final straw. I first want to test my own capabilites and go through all my 
        own problem solving techniques first. I feel the more often I attempt to use my problem solving techinques I'll be able to get better at it in the process.
        What I'll try differently is maybe not have it as my final straw.
