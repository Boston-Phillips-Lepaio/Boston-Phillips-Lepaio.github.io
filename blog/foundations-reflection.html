        3 Things I've learnt are: I have limitless potential to grow, how to be mindful and about my own emotional intelligence.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-font"> 
        Empathy, Values and Self-Awareness. All of these combine with the working together aspect of learning and programming 
        making it beneficial to learn for the sake of collaborating with your peers as well as future endeavors.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-font"> 
        What surprised me the most about the core learning is how much focus its given in Dev Academy. I appreciate the necessity 
        for human skills as I feel like its something I lack in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspects of the core learning for me was the listening and looping. I'm still getting used to not 
        treating it like a memory repeat game and to be able to speak at length about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we spend so much time on core because it develops people skills which is a vital quality needed in the field. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning the course I was confused on why core was given so much focus. After participating through a lot of the core 
        exercies like meditation, mindfulness, listening and looping and all that jazz; it slowly began to open my mind. 
        I don't think its a waste of time and that we should have programmed instead because core is a different type of learning thats hard to find anywhere, 
        especially in a dev course I think.
