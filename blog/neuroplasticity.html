        Understanding neuroplasticity will benefit you people by opening their mind to the limitless potential of their brains. 
        Not only can it help in learning new things easier, it can also help with depression, help recover from brain trauma/injures 
        and even increase your brain volume and memory.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-font"> 
        Neuroplasticity can help me achieve whatever I set my mind to, my capabilities for knowledge are boundless as long as 
        I myself believe it so. I'll use these principles to further my goals starting from Dev Academy to a future in tech.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-font"> 
        A healthy body equals a healthy mind. To increase your neuroplasticity then you need to first help your body. 
        Eating healthy foods with nutrients that support brain function as well as regular aerobic exercise are some of 
        the few ways to increase neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is a mindset where you are aware of the fact that your knowledge has no limits and can grow. 
        Its relevent for when you feel blocked, know that you can only continue to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was surprised by the amount of ways that neuroplasticity and growth mindset can benefit you. Understanding these principles 
        and key charachteristics will help me when I reach blocks. It's fine to not know, because you can only grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going forward, I'll not stress over my failings and mistakes and instead see them as things I can learn from. It's not easy to
        jump into straight away but with time I can make it work.
