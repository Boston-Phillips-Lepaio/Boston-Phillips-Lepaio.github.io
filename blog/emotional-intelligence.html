        <p class="paragraph-font"> Emotional intelligence (Emotional quotient or EQ) is using emotions to communicate with others effectively. It is defined by 5 Key Aspects: Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy and Social skills. Emotional intelligence is crucial in roles of teamwork and leadership, developing it will greatly improve your lifestyle through personal relationships and success in the workplace, as it allows you to better facilitate yourself, understand yourself and other people.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-font"> IQ differs from EQ where IQ measures cognitive intelligence. The use of IQ is shown in tasks such asmathematical skills, memory, reasoning and problem-solving. These kinds of tasks focus on showing analytical and logical prowess. EQ on the other hand is shown in tasks such as Leadership, teamwork activities and customer service. These tasks more greatly benefit from High EQ as it focuses on your social awareness and self-management abilities.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-font"> A specific example where EQ would be important is in applying for jobs. There are 2 people, Person A is extremely gifted in IQ perfectly demonstrates that they would be able to get the job done. Sadly, person A is rude and hard to work with. Person B on the other hand is pretty smart, suited for the job for sure but not nearly as much as Person A. What Person B bests Person A in though is; they are much more friendly to work with and their ability to communicate effectively makes them a much better fit. You can always teach someone how to work better but its much harder to train someones personality and emotional intelligence.</p>
